Feedback Loop, Collaboration, AI/Automation, 

# Feedback Loop Tooling:
- Agents communicating to determine:
  - What is on the persons mind
  - What they are likely missing
  - If they can autocomplete the most likely next action.
- CI/CD
- SMT Solving/Intellitest
- File Monitoring for:
  - Auto commit/merge
  - Auto type checking/linting
